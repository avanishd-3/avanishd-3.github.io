  My first blog post

Welcome to the launch of this blog. I will be periodically updating this site with whatever random thoughs I want to write down.

## Launch

I created this blog using the [Astro Paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) template. I've only changed the themes (along with the default timezone), but it's pretty minimal, so I should be able to continue making changes to the look and feel of this site.

If you're unaware of [Astro](https://astro.build/), you should check it out. It's a successor to static site generators like Jekyll, only with more features like type safety (since TS is the default) and SSR. Also, the [islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) concept is a really nice approach to embedding interactivity in a mostly static site, and (for me at least) is a lot more pleasant and fun to use than NextJS.

Anyways, that's it for now. Check out the main site for more posts (coming soon).
